# BattleBeyz

BattleBeyz is a 3D game that uses OpenGL for rendering graphics. My goal is to create the first realistic Beyblade game that handles high-speed collisions with custom physics, and I wanted to learn from the process of creating a game from scratch.

Any collaboration or feedback is welcome!

## Features (So far!)

- Basic 3D rendering with OpenGL
- Font rendering with FreeType
- Basic Camera control
- Basic Lighting and shading
